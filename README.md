# Self-Driving AI for GTA 5

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of an AI that autonomously navigates vehicles in the popular game GTA 5. Using Python, this AI demonstrates the integration of machine learning and game simulation to create a realistic self-driving experience.

## Features
- **Autonomous Driving**: Navigate through the dynamic environment of GTA 5 without manual intervention.
- **Data Collection**: Scripts for efficient data gathering from the game environment.
- **AI Training**: Tools and scripts for training the AI model on collected data.
- **Testing and Validation**: Comprehensive testing to ensure AI performance and reliability.

## Components
- `collect_data.py`: Script for data collection.
- `train_model.py`: AI model training script.
- `test_model.py`: For testing the AI model.
- `directkeys.py`: Interface with game controls.
- `getkeys.py`: Key logging for data collection.
- `grabscreen.py`: Captures game screen for data input.
- `models.py`: AI model definitions.
- `motion.py`: Handling AI movement within the game.
